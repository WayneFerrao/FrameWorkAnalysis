# Web Development Framework Analysis
Friends and I used React and NodeJS  to build a multi-page web app. 
React and NodeJS were used as the front and back end frameworks. We used Material UI's React library to add functionality to the web app. In addition, the React Router library and Styled Components library were used to route between pages and style the webpages.
